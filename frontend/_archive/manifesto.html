        <h1>The Code of Harmony</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Why a Violinist is the Best Person to Fix Your Data Pipeline.</p>

        <div class="manifesto-text">
            <p>We tend to think of "Systems" and "Art" as opposing forces. One is rigid, the other fluid. One is code,
                the other emotion.</p>

            <p>I disagree.</p>

            <p>For 20 years, I operated within one of the most complex, high-stakes systems in human history: <span
                    class="highlight">The Orchestra.</span></p>

            <p>An orchestra is a distributed system. It has latency (the speed of sound). It has concurrency (100
                players). It has a single source of truth (the score). And when it fails, it fails publicly.</p>

            <h2>The Pivot</h2>
            <p>Two years ago, I began translating these principles into code. I didn't just learn "Javascript"; I
                learned how to orchestrate information.</p>

            <p><strong>Projectorium AI</strong> isn't just a music app. It's a study in <em>asynchronous
                    consensus</em>—how do we get a group of people to agree on a creative direction without being in the
                same room?</p>

            <p><strong>Space Time Tuning Machine</strong> isn't just performance art. It's a <em>temporal
                    database</em>—a way to visualize time not as a straight line, but as a loop, a cycle, a wave.</p>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>I am now applying this "Polyphonic Systems Design" to civic infrastructure. Our public institutions are
                bad orchestras. They are playing out of tune. They are ignoring the conductor.</p>

            <p>I am here to fix the score.</p>
